Glass Power Level provides you a quick way to access your battery level and charging status via a voice command or through a persistent live card.

To activate, say "ok glass, calculate" or if you have more than one app that supports the calculate voice trigger, "ok glass, calculate power level!"

You can deactivate the announcement by using the mute button in the menu of the live card.
